TicTacToe_Project
=================

This is is top-level repository for the app. Be sure to clone it with a recent
git and "git clone --recursive" to include the component modules. If you have
the Android SDK and Gradle installed, "gradle assembleDebug" should work out of
the box, and "gradle assembleRelase" should work if your keystore is in
${HOME}/.keystore.

Prebuilt version is available through Google play:
